[Website Demo Video](https://d.pr/v/beeQ7M)

A fully functional hotel booking system designed to provide small hotels and homestays with a cost-effective, modern, and easy-to-use platform for managing their operations. This project was created using **Bolt.new AI**, leveraging its capabilities to generate both frontend and backend components.

## Motivation

I’ve always envisioned creating something meaningful—a solution that empowers small hotels and homestays to thrive in today’s competitive landscape. These establishments often lack access to quick, cost-effective, and efficient booking systems. I wanted to build a platform that simplifies operations, reduces management overhead, and offers a seamless modern UI for both customers and administrators. However, like many, I found myself constrained by time, resources, and technical challenges.

When I discovered Bolt.new AI, I decided to take a leap of faith and see if this innovative tool could help me bring my vision to life. To my amazement, in just 24 hours and with a modest budget of $100, I was able to create the foundation for a fully functional hotel booking system. From the frontend to the backend, the AI-powered platform enabled me to achieve something I had only dreamed of.

While the system is far from perfect, I believe it has the potential to grow into a transformative tool for small businesses in the hospitality industry. This is where I need your help. Whether you’re a developer, designer, or simply someone who shares the vision of supporting small businesses, your contribution can make a real difference.

This project is more than just code; it’s an opportunity to empower communities, simplify lives, and create something that could truly change the way small hotels and homestays operate. Together, we can turn this initial prototype into a system that provides value for years to come.

I invite you to join me on this journey. Let’s collaborate, innovate, and make this project a success. Your expertise, feedback, and support could shape this platform into a game-changer for small businesses worldwide.
